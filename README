dolly is a tool to create a clone of a VFS constituted of ZFS. It is based on
snapshots and clone command. For more info : check the README_DOLLY

tzm-sched is a script which use tsm (Tivoli Storage Manager or dsmc)
and the snapshot of ZFS filesystem. Unfortunately, as dsmc is unable to backup ZFS from their
snapshots in an scheduler way. So here it is our solution.
Check the README_TZM_SCHED

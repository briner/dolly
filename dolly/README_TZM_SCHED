tzm-sched is a script which use tsm (Tivoli Storage Manager or dsmc)
and the snapshot of ZFS filesystem. Unfortunately, as dsmc is unable to backup ZFS from their
snapshots in an scheduler way. So here it is our solution.

The way we implemented this, is the following:
tzm-sched pre-tsm in the crontab and will do
 - stop services
 - write the metadata (zfs list; zpool listâ€¦)
 - do the snapshots and  create a clone of the VFS(Virtual FS) mounted
   on /dolly/backup with (dolly clone)
 - start the services
 - generate a include/exclude file which will be used by dsmc-sched
 - enable the scheduler daemon with (svcadm enable -s dsmc-sched)
 
dsmc will start backuping when the server told him to do (scheduler way)

tzm-sched post-tsm called within the POSTSchedulecmd will do:
 - undo the clone with "dolly kill" and destroy 7 days old snapshots
 - rotate the log and parse the log to send an email if it find errors on it
 - disable dsm-sched with a (echo "svcadm disable -s dsmc-sched" | at 'now + 1minutes')

This tool was mainly created to decrease the time of the down time when backuping
and to benefit the property of the zfs snapshot : quick and a coherent FS where
all the files are snapshoted at the same time.

If you find this script useful, consider a recommendation on LinkedIn with my
